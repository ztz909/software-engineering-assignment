# software-engineering-assignment
This project is the general outline of a Fivver clone of sorts meant to be made for artists(could have been an early NFT marketplace if we had thought of it but no). This is meant to be a very very simple PubSub(publisher subcriber architecture). Also some diagrams are included to describe some use cases, sequences, classes and activities.
